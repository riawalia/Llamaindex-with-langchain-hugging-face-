# Llamaindex-with-Llama2-using-hugging-face
This project demonstrates the setup and application of the Llama2 language model using Hugging Face's library to create an information retrieval system. The project includes the installation of several libraries to optimize the performance and functionality of the model, such as sentence transformers for embedding extraction and llama_index for managing document indexing and querying. It outlines the process of loading documents, setting up the language model with appropriate configurations, and integrating embeddings for enhanced query handling. Finally, it demonstrates querying the model to retrieve information on energy-saving measures for buildings.
